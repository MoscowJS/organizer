## Communication with speakers

### Selecting proposals

Each meetup has **four** talks, 20 minutes each (15 for presentation + 5
for q&a). Three of them are selected from our waiting list and one can be
suggested by the venue (main sponsor). If the venue doesn't have a
speaker, we select all four from the waiting list.

Our waiting list is [here][waiting-list] (you need to be an organizer to
access the document). Applications there are sorted by submition date.
Those, that have not yet being scheduled, are highlighted in red. Authors
of those proposals you'll need to contact, starting from the oldest
submitions.

Please contact 3-4 persons from the waiting list and suggest to give a
talk at the next event. In this letter please provide date and venue of
the meetup. Make sure to include a link to our [Speaker's
Manual][speaker].

Some will accept, some will decline, some will not reply at all. Please
don't wait for replies for more than 3-4 days, instead, get in touch with
the next batch of speakers from the waiting list. Repeat the process until
you have all four speakers ready to go.


### Requesting information from speakers

Once a speaker has agreed to participate, please request all the
information necessary to announce his or her talk. All the information
required is listed in [Speaker's Manual][announcement-info].
