      simply welcome guests


## Communication with speakers

### Selecting proposals

Each meetup has **four** talks, 20 minutes each (15 for presentation + 5
for q&a). Three of them are selected from our waiting list and one can be
suggested by the venue (main sponsor). If the venue doesn't have a
speaker, we select all four from the waiting list.

Our waiting list is [here][waiting-list] (you need to be an organizer to
access the document). Applications there are sorted by submition date.
Those, that have not yet being scheduled, are highlighted in red. Authors
of those proposals you'll need to contact, starting from the oldest
submitions.

Please contact 3-4 persons from the waiting list and suggest to give a
talk at the next event. In this letter please provide date and venue of
the meetup. Make sure to include a link to our [Speaker's
Manual][speaker].

Some will accept, some will decline, some will not reply at all. Please
don't wait for replies for more than 3-4 days, instead, get in touch with
the next batch of speakers from the waiting list. Repeat the process until
you have all four speakers ready to go.


### Requesting information from speakers

Once a speaker has agreed to participate, please request all the
information necessary to announce his or her talk. All the information
required is listed in [Speaker's Manual][announcement-info].


### Scheduling and conducting rehearsals

```js
// work in progress
```

## Communication with venues

### How to reach out to potential host venues

Two options:

* Find a person who works there and is interested in a meetup you're
  organizing. Ask this person to talk to people responsible for internal
  and external events (usually HR).

* If a recruiter from the target company reaches out *to you*, write him
  back and suggest hosting a meetup. This worked really well for us.

### How can a host company help your meetup

It depends on a company. Most can provide:

* Venue
* Snacks
* Video recording of the talks
* Extra PR
* Help on site

Some can also do:

* Swag (t-shirts, cups)
* Cover travel expences for speakers

### What can you as a meetup offer your sponsors

* Recruiting possibilities:
* Recognition amongst your audience
* One slot booked for the speakers from the hosting company


### Negotiations process

Start negotiating with the potential hosting company as early as possible,
but no latter than one month before the event.

This is our [proposal to potential hosts][host-proposal] (in russian).
Feel free to use it.

## Communication with attendees

### Where to announce new events

We use these means of communication with the audience on the web:

- Newsletter
- [Site][site]
- [FB group][fb]
- Twitter [@moscowjs][twitter]

We've recently started the initiative to support free IT meetups in Russia.
If you would like to share your event with our audience, [let us
know][issues-newsletter].


### Gathering feedback after the event

Please copy and send [this form][feedback-form] to everyone registered for
the event. Please make sure to change the names of the talks.

After a couple of days this form was live, please share the results of the
questionnaire with everyone in MoscowJS Speakers Group.
